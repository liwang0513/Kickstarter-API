Were gonna make an API out of Kickstarter.com by scraping their AJAX calls. Were gonna use NodeJS with the help of our framework called Cornerstore. 

Npm install -g cs to get the framework. 
Then you can cs init {{project}}
To start the framework and serve your project, just 'cs run' and then point your browser to localhost:3000

Using this technique you can really scrape any websites ajax calls and for your own API calls.
